A (b): We would need to directly make a new array each time a modification is made. So for example, if we were to add an element, we'd create a new array with that one element, proceeded by concatenating it with the old one and overriding it back to the variable that pointed to the original array. 
A (c): I wouldn't be using arrays for this, but rather a linked list since we are only mostly interested in only accessing the first and last elements. Linked lists need not have to re-write the entire array each time we remove or add an element, hence it'd be faster. As linked lists are simply nodes connected to one another, we should also make a counter to keep track of how many elements are there instead of traversing down each node every time we need a count of the number of elements in our queue.
